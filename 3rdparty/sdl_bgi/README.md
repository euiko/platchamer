This is `SDL_bgi`, a graphics C library based on SDL2. `SDL_bgi`
provides graphics primitives, and is much easier to use than plain
SDL2. It should be especially useful for beginners, i.e. in
introductory programming courses.

`SDL_bgi` is nearly fully compatible with BGI (`graphics.h`), the
Borland Graphics Interface that was the de facto standard in PC
graphics back in DOS days. For instance, it compiles and runs the
original `bgidemo.c` almost perfectly. `SDL_bgi` is pretty fast and
very easy to use, and it also provides extensions for ARGB colours,
mouse support, and multiple windows. It should run on any platform
supported by SDL2; it was tested in GNU/Linux, Windows (MSYS2 +
Mingw-w64, CodeBlocks, Dev-C++), and Mac OS X Yosemite.

I wrote `SDL_bgi` because I wanted a simple but fast graphics library
for my experiments with fractals and cellular automata, using the BGI
syntax I'm used to. Obviously, native SDL2 functions can be used in
`SDL_bgi` programs.

A few examples are provided in the `test/` directory.

If you don't need BGI compatibility, I suggest that you check out
SDL_gfx, a graphics library more complete and more powerful than
`SDL_bgi`.
