Sample Programs

   Programs in sample directory are sample of libraries xbgi and
  graffit. All binaries of each will be built when your executed
  ``xmkmf -a; make'' at top directory of xbgi.

   If you want to make with installed libraries xbgi and graffit,
  please type as follows at samples directory:

    % imake -DUseInstalled -DUseInstalledXBGI -I<xlibdir>/config

    ``<xlibdir>'' is X11's library directory, for example,
  ``/usr/X11R6/lib/X11''. Please type as follows if you find out this
  directory:

    % xmkmf
    mv -f Makefile Makefile.bak
    imake -DUseInstalled -I/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/config

Internationalization

   Programs ``hello2.c'', ``hello2-sj.c'' and ``hello2-jis.c'' are the
  same programs but kinds of Japanese KANJI code, ``euc'',
  ``mscode(shift-jis)'' and ``jis(7bit)''. Please try to execute as
  follows when your X server supports Multilingual mechanism and
  Japanese locale:

    % env LANG=japanese hello2 
    % env LANG=ja hello2
    % env LANG=ja_JP.ujis hello2
    % env LANG=ja_JP.mscode hello2-sj
    % env LANG=ja_JP.jis7 hello2-jis

   You need to examine locale and it's aliases which described in
 ``<xlibdir>/nls'' and ``<xlibdir>/nls/nls.alias'' of each kind of
 Japanese KANJI code, if you failed above variables of LANG.
