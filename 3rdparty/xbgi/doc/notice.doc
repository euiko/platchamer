About a sample program using XView

  In making of xvsample/sponge.c, you may fail to built it by cause of SunOS's
  version and X11's version or not. I don't know the origin of failing.
  Error message is as follows:

    | ld: Undefined symbol
    |   _cm_close
    |   _cm_put
    |   _cm_open
    | collect2: ld returned 2 exit status
    | *** Error code 1

  By the way, in the case of undefined ``XFontSet'' in Xlib.h such as X11R4 or
  old OpenWindow, please don't define ``EnableMultilingual'' in ``configre.h''.
  You must define ``EnableBilingual'' in it's place for using your language.
