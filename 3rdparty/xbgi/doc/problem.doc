Problems

  This library have some problems as follows ('*' means un-solved):

  + version 2.1: The procedure ``floodfill'' is very dull.
    (From version 2.2, It was repaired using large memory.)
  * version 2.1: In functions ``getimage'',``getpixel'' which are to get image,
    when the window is unmapped such as iconified,
    the process is stopped by these functions with X error.
  * version 2.1: The process is stopped with the same cause by saving graph
    procedures, ``savegraphtoxbm'' and ``savegraphtoxpm''.
  + version 2.1: I have not yet tried working on visual classes Static Color,
    Static Gray. But I have confirmed it on monochrome.
    (From version 2.2, Static Color is completely supported.
    Thus, named colors are able to be setted by using ``-colornames'' option.
    (ex) % setenv XBGISET '-colornames Black Blue Red ...'
    (ex) initgraph( &gd, &gm, "-colornames Black Blue Red ..." );)
  + version 2.1: I have not yet confirmed working on X terminals.
    (From version 2.2, By above mentioned repairing, it does work
    on various X client.)
  * version 2.1: The option ``-icon'' which is to set icon picture can't work.
  + version 2.1: Drawing text can't work when X can't find font structure.
    (From version 2.2, it works with dummy font informations.)
  + version 3.0: At installation to your own home directory, you could not
    install files to ~/include/xbgi, ~/bin, ~/lib, because I made a mistake
    in Imakefiles. (From version 3.01, it was corrected.)
  + version 3.0: In text drawing with X11 multilingual mechanism,
    there is a mistake of getting size of text on the specifications.
    (From version 3.01, it was corrected.)
  + version 3.0: I made a mistake of the color table in ``Static Gray'',
    therefore you always can use only 2 colors and BlackPixel and WhitePixel
    are assigned to the same place in the table depending upon X server.
    (From version 3.01, it was corrected.)

  If you find other problems and its cause, I'm looking forward to your kindly
  advice.
