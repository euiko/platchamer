OPTION

NAME
  scan_option - analyze command line options routine

SYNOPSIS
  ! #include <option.h>
  ! int scan_option( argc, argv, key, ... )
  ! int argc;      -- the number of command line arguments
  ! char *argv[];  -- command line arguments
  ! char *key, ... -- string which express ``key'' and arguments

DESCRIPTION
  + If there is key to scan in command line options, true(=!0) is returned.
    For an example, if there is "-help" in command line options,
    scan_option( argc, argv, "-help" ) returns !0.
  + If there is key to scan with "scanf format",
    variable(s) is(are) scanned and !0 is returned.
    For an example, if there is "-geom 100x100" in command line options,
    scan_option( argc, argv, "-geom %dx%d", &W, &H ) returns !0 and
    sets 100 and 100 in W and H, respectively.
  + If key is like "-on[-]", it is considered to be flag,
    multi-variable argument needs a int* type pointer.
    In this case, there is "-on" or "-on-" in command line, thie routine
    substitutes !0, 0 to the address of a int* type pointer.
  + If key is like "-enum BLACK BLUE RED", which includes space and not
    scanf format, it is considered to be enumerate,
    multi-variable argument needs a int* type pointer.
    In this case, there is "-enum RED" in command line,
    thie routine substitutes 2 the address of a int* type pointer.
